 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1

My Prototype game involves a player character collecting keys and avoiding bullets shot down from turrets; the player's goal is to make it to the door at the end of the level, which will unlock and glow bright blue once all the keys have been collecting. My goal was to create a player environment that was challenging, and one that rewarded patience. Using the MDA framework, I envisioned what I wanted the player to be feeling as they practiced the game and made decisions based on that experience. For example, on the last level I wanted it to be a true challenge, so I added as many obstacles as I could. Before making the game I consdiered adding the slingshot mechanic from MissionDemolition to add some complexity to the game. As I played the game with the turrets I found that adding the slingshot grew to be too complex and cluttered the game's screen. The turrets were enough of a challenge as it is! This is also why the player character has 3 lives on each level; they will need it!!
